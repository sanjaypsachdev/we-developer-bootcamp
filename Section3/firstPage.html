  <p><strong>Python</strong>, like most other <em>modern programming languages</em>, has its own unique way of downloading, storing, and resolving packages (or modules). While this has its advantages, there were some interesting decisions made about package storage and resolution, which has lead to some problemsâ€”particularly with how and where packages are stored.</p>
  <p>There are a few different locations where these packages can be installed on your system. For example, most system packages are stored in a child directory of the path stored in sys.prefix.</p>
  <p>On Mac OS X, you can easily find where sys.prefix points to using the Python shell:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Red</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
    <li>Yellow
      <ul>
        <li>Sunflower</li>
        <li>Banana
          <ol>
            <li>Frozen Banana</li>
            <li>Non-Frozen Banana</li>
          </ol>
